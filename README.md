FastGR
======

Lots of wonderful text about this being a GUI to do a Fourier transform.

Building
--------
Before doing the normal `python setup.py ...` things you must convert the
`designer/*.ui` files to `fastgr*.py`. This is done with
`python setup.py pyuic`. After that, all the normal
[setuptools](https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html) magic applies.
