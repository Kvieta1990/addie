FastGR
======

Lots of wonderful text about this being a GUI to do a Fourier transform.

Building
--------
Before doing the normal `python setup.py ...` things you must convert the
`designer/*.ui` files to `fastgr*.py`. This is done with
`python setup.py pyuic`. After that all normal
[distutils](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Distutils/) magic applies.
